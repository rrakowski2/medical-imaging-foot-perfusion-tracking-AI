## Repository Overview

This repository presents a fully automated thermal perfusion analysis tool powered by an AI-based computer vision model (U-Net implemented in PyTorch). The system tracks foot displacement and infers the progression of selected temperature statistics across plantar angiosomes.

## Implementation Notes
 
To simplify presentation, the core functionality is contained within a small number of scripts rather than being fully modularized.
