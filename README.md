## The repository showcases a fully automated thermal perfusion analysis tool built on an AI-powered computer vision model (U-Net implemented in PyTorch). It tracks foot displacement and infers the evolution of selected temperature statistics within plantar angiosomes.

## The functionality is contained within a few scripts rather than being modularized, in order to simplify presentation.
